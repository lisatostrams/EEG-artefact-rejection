# EEG-artefact-rejection
Machine learning techniques for EEG

## Content
### EEG data (Klados datasets)
Contains information on the simulated data, as described in 'A semi-simulated EEG/EOG dataset for the  comparison of EOG artifact rejection techniques' by Klados (2016). 

### Literature 
Contains all articles cited in 'EEG artifact correction report' and 'SOBI implementation doc'.

### Meta docs
Contains all meta information about the planning of this project. 

### plot scripts
Contains all scripts used for creating plots in presentations, report, and implementation documentation.

### SOBI
Contains the following files written in Python 3.4:
* SOBI.py: The class containing the Second Order Blind Inference algorithm.
* joint_diagonalizer.py: Script containing 4 algorithms that can be used for joint diagonalization.
* sim_data.py: Script that reads the simulated data from the Data folder and returns it as an array object.
* Validate.py: The class object used to validate the correction applied by the SOBI algorithm for either simulated data or acquired data. 

Contains the following subfolders:
* acdc: Matlab files of ACDC algorithm implementation by 
 Dr. Arie Yeredor,
 School of Electrical Engineering,
 Tel-Aviv University.

* crossval: data generated by cross-validation analysis, formatted in csv files.
* Data: the Klados datasets. See header 'EEG data (Klados datasets)' for more information
* Figures: contains 3 subfolders with figures of 'BandX': true and observed signals, 'Corrections': corrections applied by SOBI with parameters as described by Belouchrani(1997), Sutherland(2004) and Joyce(2004).
* frob: C files of Fast Frobenius algorithm implementation as used in R.
